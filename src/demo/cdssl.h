/*
 * Initialize and configure the SSL context.

 * This context applies to all SSL connections made in the the program.
 *
 * verify_options is a bitmask.
 * Valid options for a client are:
 *      SSL_VERIFY_NONE                     Continue if server does not provide cert
 *      SSL_VERIFY_PEER                     Fail if server does not provide cert
 *
 * Valid options for a server are:
 *      SSL_VERIFY_NONE                     Do not send certificate request to client
 *      SSL_VERIFY_PEER                     Send certificate request. Client need not provide cert.
 *      SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT     Fail if client does not provide cert. Must be used with SSL_VERIFY_PEER.
 *      SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE              Only request client cert once.  Must be used with SSL_VERIFY_PEER.
 *
 * OpenSSL will call verify_callback during the certificate verification process.
 * It will only hit if SSL_VERIFY_PEER is set.
 *
 * verify_callback's full signature is:
 *      int (*verify_callback)(int preverify_ok, X509_STORE_CTX *x509_ctx)
 *  preverify_ok is the current status of the OpenSSL verification: 1 for success, 0 for failure.
 *  x509_ctx is the complete X509 certificate chain context.
 *  The return value will alter/override OpenSSL's verification result: 1 for success, 0 for failure.
 *
 * verify_callback can be NULL, in which case the value of OpenSSL verification is used.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the SSL context on success, NULL on error.
 * The caller is responsible for freeing the SSL context using SSL_CTX_free().
