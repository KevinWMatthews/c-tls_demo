Certificate genearation process:

Generate Certificate Authority key and certificate:
$ ./generate_crt.sh config/ca.cnf keys/ca.key keys/ca.crt
$ ./verify_key.sh keys/ca.key
$ ./verify_crt.sh keys/ca.crt

Generate Certificate Signing Request for server:
$ ./generate_csr.sh config/server.cnf keys/server.key keys/server.csr
$ ./verify_key.sh keys/server.key
$ ./verify_csr.sh keys/server.csr

Sign Certificate Signing Request for server:
$ ./sign_csr.sh keys/ca.crt keys/ca.key config/server.cnf keys/server.csr keys/server.crt
$ ./verify_crt.sh keys/server.crt

Generate and sign client certificate:
$ ./generate_csr.sh config/client.cnf keys/client.key keys/client.csr
$ ./verify_key.sh keys/client.key
$ ./verify_csr.sh keys/client.csr
$ ./sign_csr.sh keys/ca.key config/client.cnf keys/client.csr keys/client.crt
$ ./verify_crt.sh keys/client.crt

Generate Diffie-Hellman params for server app:
$ ./generate_diffie_hellman_params.sh



We could generate a Certificate Signing Request and send it off to a Certificate Authority for approval.
For us, a self-signed certificate is sufficient.

Traditional encryption:
    Bob and Alice get each other's public keys

    [random data encrypted with Alice's public key]
    Bob      =>     Alice
                    Decrypts random data.
                    (Can only be decrypted with Alice's private key)
    Bob     <=      Alice


TLS (SSL) certificates:
    Server:
        Generate certificate

    User:
        Load server certificate to client

    Server:
        Hash certificate
        Encrypt with private key
        Append to certificate
        Server sends this new certificate to client

    Client:
        decrypts hash using the public key from the manually loaded certificate (not in the certificate that the server sent)
        calculates its own hash
        compares calculated hash to decrypted hash

    Client:
        generate random number
        encrypt with public key from manually loaded certificate
        send to server

    Server:
        decrypt random data with its private key
        send decrypted data to client

    Client:
        compare received data to generated data
